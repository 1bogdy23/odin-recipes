         <p><strong>Eggplant parmesan is an Italian American entrée similar to lasagna in flavor—the combination of crispy and soft eggplant, silky tomato sauce, and gooey, melted cheese makes for an entrée as satisfying as lasagna, with no pasta needed.</strong></p>
             <p>Because breading can be tricky if you have gluten sensitivity and frying eggplant isn’t the healthiest treatment for the veggie, we’ve come up with an oven baked version that also happens to be gluten free and equally as delicious as the traditional version.</p>
            <p>This entrée serves four and reheats without losing any texture. It's a modern take on a classic entrée that can be enjoyed by assorted special diet followers, as it’s both gluten free, keto friendly, and vegetarian. It's a good weeknight meal, but fancy enough for a date night or gathering.

        <p>Ingredients</p>
        <ul>
            <li>1 large eggplant, cut into 12 1/2-inch wide circular slices</li>
            <li>2 teaspoons salt, divided</li>
            <li>3 tablespoons extra virgin olive oil, divided</li>
            <li>4 cloves garlic, minced</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon Italian seasoningr</li>
            <li>2 (15-ounce cans or jars) tomato puree</li>
            <li>2 tablespoons tomato paste</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon red wine, optional</li>
            <li>1/8 teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
            <li>1 cup shredded mozzarella cheese</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Steps</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Season the eggplant slices with 1 1/2 teaspoons of salt and place them into a colander. Set the eggplant aside for one hour in the sink, then use your hands to press out as much liquid as you can.

                Take each slice and press it between your hands, allowing the water to drain out (you can also use a paper towel for this step). Use a light squeezing motion; squeeze too hard and you’ll tear the eggplant.
                
                As you do this, you’ll be rubbing off much of the excess salt, which will prevent the eggplant from being overly salty.</li>
            <li>Preheat your oven to 425°F. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper. Drizzle the parchment paper with 1 tablespoon olive oil.</li>
            <li>Pour the almond flour onto a large plate. Dip each eggplant slice into the almond flour on both sides, then place on the baking sheet. Because they will shrink as they cook, they can be placed very close together, so long as they don’t overlap. Drizzle the dredged eggplant with an additional tablespoon of olive oil.</li>
            <li>Bake the eggplant for 20 minutes. Carefully remove the eggplant from the oven and flip the eggplant slices using tongs. Return to the oven and cook for an additional 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>The almond flour should have turned fully golden on both sides and be crunchy to the touch. The eggplant itself will look pretty wilted. Remove from oven and set aside until ready to assemble the casserole.</li>
            <li>Place casserole in the oven for 20 minutes, until cheese is fully melted and lightly golden in spots. Remove from the oven and let cool for five minutes. Garnish with basil and serve.</li>
        </ol>
